# biostats-sas-examples

Example statistical analyses using SAS for applied biostatistics and
epidemiology.

This repository contains example statistical analyses developed during
graduate-level training in biostatistics and epidemiology. The scripts
demonstrate data cleaning, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing,
and regression modeling using SAS.

All datasets are either simulated or publicly available (e.g., NHANES).
This repository is intended to demonstrate reproducible, script-based
analysis workflows that can be adapted for applied public health and
translational research settings.
